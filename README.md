# Robotic-Arm-Project
This project is still a work in progress and the repository will be updated as the project proceeds.
The aim of the project is to have the robot arm sort objects by picking up and placing them down in designated positions.

## Current Version
Robot is able to move to all designated positions and pick up and place down objects (see video).
